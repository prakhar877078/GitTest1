Pull is made on every date basis to make our local repo in sync with the remote repo.

let's suppose there are 3 developers working on three different features
All three will be have 3 different branches at the end of the day  
they will merge the branch to master but on their working copy in master 
branch all the branch file will not be there as the branch has been merged with the remote repo.
So to make sync our working copy master to remote master we will have to take a pull request.

command : git pull origin master
